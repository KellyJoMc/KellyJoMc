### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final project for graduation from Entity Academy's data science program. You can find my related code and other files in my final project repository below. 
I have grown especially fond of and skilled in machine learning, and hope you find the work I did in that area for my final project interesting. 
In my KellyJoMc repository, you can find other projects I completed during the program. I hope you enjoy!
